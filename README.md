# Healytics

Healytics is an intelligent, web-based healthcare decision-support system designed to assist clinicians in early disease detection and data-driven medical decision-making. The platform consolidates structured patient data—such as demographics, medical history, vital signs, laboratory parameters, symptoms, and medical images—into a unified interface and applies machine learning techniques to analyze health risks and clinical patterns.

The application features a split-screen dashboard layout, where the left panel enables doctors to input and review patient information, record symptoms, add clinical notes, prescribe treatments, and upload diagnostic images (X-ray, CT, MRI). The system dynamically evaluates patient vitals, generates analytical assumptions, and computes an overall health score represented through interactive visualizations such as donut charts.

The right panel presents an interactive 3D human anatomical model (male/female) that visually maps predicted conditions and affected body regions. The anatomical viewer supports rotation, zooming, layer control (organs, bones, muscles, nerves, etc.), and real-time highlighting based on patient data analysis, enabling intuitive interpretation of complex clinical information.

Healytics aims to bridge the gap between raw medical data and actionable insights by integrating AI-based disease prediction, patient-parameter analysis, and basic medical image processing into a single scalable platform. This project demonstrates how modern AI and visualization techniques can enhance diagnostic accuracy, reduce clinical workload, and support proactive healthcare delivery.
